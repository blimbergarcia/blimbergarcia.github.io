You have the ability to hack into the school computer system. You can change peopleâ€™s grades. Would
you change your own? Why or why not? What if you could change the grade for a basketball player who 
has a scholarship to play for a big university?

Three reasons why I would change peoples grades and mine is because maybe we have a teacher that fails a lot of kids for being to picky or extra. Maybe this teacher doesn't get along with the student for a specific reason.
   Or they may had siblings in the past that didn't get along with this teacher and that is effecting the way the teacher treats the student. So i would change their grade and mine. If I knew this guy or women had passion and would go far in a sports career 
   I would for sure do it because having one bad grade thats holding you back from you passion because of a stupid reason shouldn't stop you. 
   Three reasons why I wouldn't change peoples grades and mine would be because I could get caught. Also because if you didn't try hard enough that means you didn't want it as bad.
   Final reason would be because you are lying to yourself and colleges that believe you got a good grade.
