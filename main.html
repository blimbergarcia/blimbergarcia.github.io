I am a 15 year old attending Covina High School. I played football for my first time this year. Also joined my first soccer team this year. It was't the best season but we learned a lot on what not to do next year. 
Now I have joined track for my 2nd time.My favorit topic in school is Math with Mrs.Prado.

My passion is soccer, I've loved soccer since I've touched the ball with my feet the very first time. I havn't been playing for a long time, I sure do love it though when I'm playing against a really good team
   that is making the game exciting.
